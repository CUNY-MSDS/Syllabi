### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course covers the development of predictive models using the R statistical programming language. Topics cover parametric (e.g. regression), non-parametric (e.g. classification and regression trees), and Bayesian models for predicting quantitative and qualitative outcomes. 

### PROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES ADDRESSED BY THIS COURSE:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cat(program_learning_outcomes(params$course_number))
```


### COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1.	Effectively use R for conducting analysis, creating reports, and presenting results. 
2.	Estimate predictive models using both parametric and non-parametric models. 
3.	Communicate the accuracy of predictive models using a variety of fit statistics. 
4.	Have strategies for handling missing data in the predictive modeling pipeline. 
5.	Effectively communicate the results of a predictive models.

### ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:

**Data Project** (35% Total; Proposal 15%, Final Presentation 20%) 
The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a reproducible analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example Bryer-Proposal.Rmd and Bryer-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website, so they should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis. 
 
**Homework Problems** (20%, 2.5 points each): 
This assignment aims to provide an opportunity for you to actively engage in the content you are learning in class. Homework problems are associated with each class topic (see Course Outline) and must be completed once a topic has been covered in class. Each homework assignment will include 5-10 questions that are carefully selected from the textbook. The answers to some of these questions can be found in the back of the textbook – these are good “self-check” questions to ensure you are on the right track. Assignments are graded based on completion, accuracy, and thoroughness; that means you must show your work. Doing so will help us understand where potential misunderstandings lie. 
 
**Labs** (25%, 5 points each): R is the statistical software you will use for this course. The labs aim to provide an opportunity for you to apply your statistical content knowledge in the context of problems to solve in R, thus also providing you the opportunity to practice and become familiar with the R platform and language. The labs will be guided; thus, step-by-step procedures will be laid out for you to follow in order to get the desired outputs. Interpretations of results are just as important as the results themselves, so once you have the results, interpret them in the context of the problems. Labs are graded based on completion, accuracy, and thoroughness of results and interpretations. 
 
**Final Exam** (10%): Exams will consist of conceptual, computational, and application questions, an include a combination of multiple choice, short response questions, as well as a data analysis task. The exams will focus on the material covered during the course of the semester. More detail will be provided about the material assessed by each exam closer in time to the actual exams. It should be noted that most of the statistical skills acquired during this class are constantly building upon earlier learning. This means that even though each exam will focus on the preceding section of the course, students might need to recall skills learned in earlier sections. 
 
**Participation** (10%): While attendance at synchronous meetups is not required, it is highly encouraged that you do attend: this is where you can ask questions, participate in-situ, and engage with your professor and peers. In addition, announcements and updates relating to coursework will be reviewed during these meetups.  

With that said, we understand that extenuating circumstances might not allow some of you to attend. Thus, we have built-in diagnostic and weekly formative assessment assignments that will give us an understanding of your current level of knowledge and lingering gaps in knowledge to be completed after attending or watching the recording of every meetup: 

1.	DAACS SRL (https://cuny.daacs.net) and Google Form (only once, at the beginning of the semester) 
2.	Weekly One-Minute Papers 

You will receive full points upon completion of each of these assignments.
