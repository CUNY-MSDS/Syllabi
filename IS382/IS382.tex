\subsubsection{ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:}\label{assignments-and-grading}

\textbf{Data Project} (35\% Total; Proposal 15\%, Final Presentation
20\%) The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a
reproducible analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two
components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a
pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are
provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the
R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example
Bryer-Proposal.Rmd and Bryer-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary
files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g.~data files,
screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included
below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only
requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be
shared with others on this website, so they should be presented in a way
that other students can reproduce your analysis.

\textbf{Homework Problems} (20\%, 2.5 points each): This assignment aims
to provide an opportunity for you to actively engage in the content you
are learning in class. Homework problems are associated with each class
topic (see Course Outline) and must be completed once a topic has been
covered in class. Each homework assignment will include 5-10 questions
that are carefully selected from the textbook. The answers to some of
these questions can be found in the back of the textbook -- these are
good ``self-check'' questions to ensure you are on the right track.
Assignments are graded based on completion, accuracy, and thoroughness;
that means you must show your work. Doing so will help us understand
where potential misunderstandings lie.

\textbf{Labs} (25\%, 5 points each): R is the statistical software you
will use for this course. The labs aim to provide an opportunity for you
to apply your statistical content knowledge in the context of problems
to solve in R, thus also providing you the opportunity to practice and
become familiar with the R platform and language. The labs will be
guided; thus, step-by-step procedures will be laid out for you to follow
in order to get the desired outputs. Interpretations of results are just
as important as the results themselves, so once you have the results,
interpret them in the context of the problems. Labs are graded based on
completion, accuracy, and thoroughness of results and interpretations.

\textbf{Final Exam} (10\%): Exams will consist of conceptual,
computational, and application questions, an include a combination of
multiple choice, short response questions, as well as a data analysis
task. The exams will focus on the material covered during the course of
the semester. More detail will be provided about the material assessed
by each exam closer in time to the actual exams. It should be noted that
most of the statistical skills acquired during this class are constantly
building upon earlier learning. This means that even though each exam
will focus on the preceding section of the course, students might need
to recall skills learned in earlier sections.

\textbf{Participation} (10\%): While attendance at synchronous meetups
is not required, it is highly encouraged that you do attend: this is
where you can ask questions, participate in-situ, and engage with your
professor and peers. In addition, announcements and updates relating to
coursework will be reviewed during these meetups.

With that said, we understand that extenuating circumstances might not
allow some of you to attend. Thus, we have built-in diagnostic and
weekly formative assessment assignments that will give us an
understanding of your current level of knowledge and lingering gaps in
knowledge to be completed after attending or watching the recording of
every meetup:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  DAACS SRL (https://cuny.daacs.net) and Google Form (only once, at the
  beginning of the semester)
\item
  Weekly One-Minute Papers
\end{enumerate}

You will receive full points upon completion of each of these
assignments.
