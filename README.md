# Course Syllabi for CUNY Data Science and Information Systems

- [Statistics and Probability with R](IS381/IS381.pdf)
  ([source](IS381/IS381.qmd))
- [Predictive Modeling](IS382/IS382.pdf) ([source](IS382/IS382.qmd))

## For instructors

### Editing a syllabus

If a syllabus already exists for your course you can navigate to the
`qmd` file and click the edit button (top right) and make any edits on
the Github website. Changes to the schedule (or any other Excel files)
need to be done locally and then the file can be uploaded to the correct
folder. This repo has a [Github
action](https://github.com/CUNY-MSDS/Syllabi/actions) that will
automatically rebuild PDF files after each change.

### Creating a new syllabus

You can [download this repository as a zip
file](https://github.com/CUNY-MSDS/Syllabi/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
or clone using the following command:

``` console
git clone https://github.com/CUNY-MSDS/Syllabi.git
```

The [`template`](template/) directory contains a Quarto document
template along with an Excel file for the schedule. Copy the contents of
the `template` folder into a folder for you class using the course
number (e.g.Â `IS381`, `DATA606`). Or run the following command in the
terminal:

``` console
cp -r template IS382
mv IS382/syllabus_template.qmd IS382/IS382.qmd
```

The frontmatter has a number of parameters that should be filled in,
specifically:

- `course_number` - The course number. This should start with either
  `IS` (undergraduate) or `DATA` (graduate) followed by the three digit
  number, no spaces.
- `course_name` - The course title.
- `semester` - The semester for this syllabus.
- `credits` - Credits hours.
- `instructor` - Instructor name.
- `prerequisites` - Course prerequisites.
- `email` - Email address of the instructor.
- `github` - Github username of the instructor.
- `office_hours` - Office hours.

The rest of the Quarto document can be editted in any plain text editor.
You can use most markdown formatting. [Click
here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) for an
introduction to markdown. RStudio has a visual editor as well. Note that
there a number of `include` commands that import sections required in
every syllabus (please do not edit any files in the [`common`](common/)
directory).

To build the course syllabus you can click the `Render` button in
RStudio. Or run the following command from the terminal:

``` console
quarto render IS381/IS381.qmd --to pdf
```

Note that whenever a change is made to the repository a [Github
action](https://github.com/CUNY-MSDS/Syllabi/actions) will automatically
build a PDF of the syllabus and update this README file to include links
to the available syllabi. Therefore changes can be made directly to the
`qmd` files using the editor feature of Github.
