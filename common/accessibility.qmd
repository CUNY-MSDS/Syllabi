### ACCESSIBILITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS

THE CUNY SCHOOL OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES IS COMMITTED TO MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BY REMOVING ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS AND PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT SERVICES NECESSARY FOR THEM TO BENEFIT FROM THE INSTRUCTION AND RESOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY. EARLY PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY OF THE RESOURCES AND ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED.
